# Sampling tools
## Land Cover Monitoring System

Land Cover Monitoring System (LCMS) is an initiative for mapping land cover and monitoring its changes through *remote sensing*. One of the main methods used in mapping land cover is supervised machine learning. This tool was created to facilitate the process of creating structured sample points and also provide labels that will be used as *input* in *supervised machine learning*. This tool is built in `Jupyter` platform using several *packages* such as `ipywidgets`, `ipyleaflet`, `geopandas`, and `ee`.

This tool consists of two interrelated parts, first is `stratified samples` production which distribution is based on the results of K-Means Clustering and an *user interface* based on `ipyleaflet` and `ipywidgets` for land cover sample labeling.
